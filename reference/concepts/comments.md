For this reason documentation in Go is created from the comments and there are some rules around comments to help ensure
high quality documentation.
The most visible rules are:

- Anything exported has a comment.
- A comment for an exported function has the format `// [FunctionName] does x, y, z.`
- Every package should have a comment and it starts with `// Package [PackageName]`

Comment rules are enforced by the [golint](https://github.com/golang/lint) tool which is _not_ installed with Go by default.

# Documentation

The Go tool chain provides the [godoc](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc) tool for producing documentation
as HTML or plain text from the Go source code. The generated documentation for many open source packages is available
at [godoc.org](https://godoc.org/).
