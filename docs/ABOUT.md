Go is an open source programming language started by engineers at Google: Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike (author of The Unix Programming Environment, Plan 9, UTF-8), and Ken Thompson (co-creator of Unix, Plan 9, and UTF-8 fame).  It's written using a C-style syntax, has statically typed variables, manages memory using garbage collection, and is compiled into stand-alone executables.

Go is noted for the [concurrent programming features](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#concurrency) built into the language core, the networking packages in the standard library ([such as a web server](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/)), fast compilation and execution speed, and its simple, minimalistic language design.

Fans of Go (called *gophers*) describe it as having the expressiveness of dynamic languages like Python or Ruby, with the performance of compiled languages like C or C++.

The home page for Go is [golang.org](https://golang.org/), and there is an excellent interactive tutorial at [tour.golang.org](https://tour.golang.org/).
