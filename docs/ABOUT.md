# About

Fans of Go (called *gophers*) describe Go as having the expressiveness of dynamic languages like Python or Ruby, with the performance of compiled languages like C or C++.

The language is open source, and was started by engineers at Google.
It's written using a C-style syntax, has statically typed variables, manages memory using garbage collection, and is compiled into stand-alone executables.

Go is noted for the [concurrent programming features](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#concurrency) built into the language core, the networking packages in the standard library ([such as a web server](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http)), fast compilation and execution speed.
Its simple, minimalistic and consistent language design make for a delightful experience, while the abundant and thoughtful tooling addresses traditional problems such as [consistent formatting](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/gofmt?utm_source=godoc) and [documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc?utm_source=godoc).

The home page for Go is [golang.org](https://golang.org/), and there is an excellent interactive tutorial at [tour.golang.org](https://tour.golang.org/).
