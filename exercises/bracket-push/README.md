# Bracket Push

Given a string containing brackets `[]`, braces `{}`, parentheses `()`,
or any combination thereof, verify that any and all pairs are matched
and nested correctly.

## Running the tests

To run the tests run the command `go test` from within the exercise directory.

If the test suite contains benchmarks, you can run these with the `--bench` and `--benchmem`
flags:

    go test -v --bench . --benchmem

Keep in mind that each reviewer will run benchmarks on a different machine, with
different specs, so the results from these benchmark tests may vary.
