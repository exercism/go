# Spiral Matrix

Given the size, return a square matrix of numbers in spiral order.

The matrix should be filled with natural numbers, starting from 1
in the top-left corner, increasing in an inward, clockwise spiral order,
like these examples:

###### Spiral matrix of size 3

```text
1 2 3
8 9 4
7 6 5
```

###### Spiral matrix of size 4

```text
 1  2  3 4
12 13 14 5
11 16 15 6
10  9  8 7
```

## Running the tests

To run the tests run the command `go test` from within the exercise directory.

If the test suite contains benchmarks, you can run these with the `-bench`
flag:

    go test -bench .

Keep in mind that each reviewer will run benchmarks on a different machine, with
different specs, so the results from these benchmark tests may vary.
