# Change

Correctly determine the fewest number of coins to be given to a customer such
that the sum of the coins' value would equal the correct amount of change.

## For example

- An input of 15 with [1, 5, 10, 25, 100] should return one nickel (5)
  and one dime (10) or [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
- An input of 40 with [1, 5, 10, 25, 100] should return one nickel (5)
  and one dime (10) and one quarter (25) or [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]

## Edge cases

- Does your algorithm work for any given set of coins?
- Can you ask for negative change?
- Can you ask for a change value smaller than the smallest coin value?

## Running the tests

To run the tests run the command `go test` from within the exercise directory.

If the test suite contains benchmarks, you can run these with the `--bench` and `--benchmem`
flags:

    go test -v --bench . --benchmem

Keep in mind that each reviewer will run benchmarks on a different machine, with
different specs, so the results from these benchmark tests may vary.
