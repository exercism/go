## Scoring Note

In scoring, consider a dart landing on the border of a circle to be "in the circle"
and receive the higher score, like "inward scoring" for a shooting contest.
A real dartboard avoids this issue by using lines made of wire; the dart cannot
land on a wire, but goes to one side or the other.
