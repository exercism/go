# Proverb

For want of a horseshoe nail, a kingdom was lost, or so the saying goes.

Given a list of inputs, generate the relevant proverb. For example, given the list `["nail", "shoe", "horse", "rider", "message", "battle", "kingdom"]`, you will output the full text of this proverbial rhyme:

```text
For want of a nail the shoe was lost.
For want of a shoe the horse was lost.
For want of a horse the rider was lost.
For want of a rider the message was lost.
For want of a message the battle was lost.
For want of a battle the kingdom was lost.
And all for the want of a nail.
```

Note that the list of inputs may vary; your solution should be able to handle lists of arbitrary length and content. No line of the output text should be a static, unchanging string; all should vary according to the input given.

## Coding the solution

Look for a stub file having the name proverb.go
and place your solution code in that file.

## Running the tests

To run the tests run the command `go test` from within the exercise directory.

If the test suite contains benchmarks, you can run these with the `--bench` and `--benchmem`
flags:

    go test -v --bench . --benchmem

Keep in mind that each reviewer will run benchmarks on a different machine, with
different specs, so the results from these benchmark tests may vary.
