Implement the `accumulate` operation, which, given a collection and an
operation to perform on each element of the collection, returns a new
collection containing the result of applying that operation to each element of
the input collection.

Given the collection of strings:

- "cat", "Dog", "b4t", "gO"

And the operation:

- upcase a string

Your code should be able to produce the collection of strings:

- "CAT", "DOG", "B4T, "GO"

Check out the test suite to see the expected function signature.

## Restrictions

Keep your hands off that collect/map/fmap/whatchamacallit functionality
provided by your standard library!
Solve this one yourself using other basic tools instead.
