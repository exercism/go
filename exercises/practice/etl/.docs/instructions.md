# Instructions

Your task is to change the data format of letters and their point values in the game.

Currently, letters are stored in groups based on their score, in a one-to-many mapping.

- 1 point: "A", "E", "I", "O", "U", "L", "N", "R", "S", "T",
- 2 points: "D", "G",
- 3 points: "B", "C", "M", "P",
- 4 points: "F", "H", "V", "W", "Y",
- 5 points: "K",
- 8 points: "J", "X",
- 10 points: "Q", "Z",

This needs to be changed to store each individual letter with its score in a one-to-one mapping.

- "a" is worth 1 point.
- "b" is worth 3 points.
- "c" is worth 3 points.
- "d" is worth 2 points.
- etc.

As part of this change, the team has also decided to change the letters to be lower-case rather than upper-case.

If you want to look at how the data was previously structured and how it needs to change, take a look at the examples in the test suite.
