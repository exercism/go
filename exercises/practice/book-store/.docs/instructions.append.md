# Implementation

Define a single Go func, Cost, which calculates the cost
for a given list of books based on the defined discounts.

Use the following signature for func Cost:

```
func Cost(books []int) int
```
Cost will return the total cost (after discounts) in cents.
For example, for a single book, the cost is 800 cents, which equals $8.00.
Only integer calculations are necessary for this exercise.
