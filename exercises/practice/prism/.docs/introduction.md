# Introduction

You're a researcher at **PRISM** (Precariously Redirected Illumination Safety Management), working with a precision laser calibration system that tests experimental crystal prisms.
These crystals are being developed for next-generation optical computers, and each one has unique refractive properties based on its molecular structure.
The lab's laser system can damage crystals if they receive unexpected illumination, so precise path prediction is critical.
