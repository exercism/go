It's all very complicated, but the basic idea is that sometimes people's bodies produce too much of a given protein.
That can cause all sorts of havoc.

But if you can create a very specific molecule (called a micro-RNA), it can prevent the protein from being produced.

This technique is called [RNA Interference][rnai].
