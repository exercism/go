# RNA Transcription

Given a DNA strand, return its RNA complement (per RNA transcription).

Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.

The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**),
guanine (**G**) and thymine (**T**).

The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**),
guanine (**G**) and uracil (**U**).

Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing
each nucleotide with its complement:

* `G` -> `C`
* `C` -> `G`
* `T` -> `A`
* `A` -> `U`

## Coding the solution

Look for a stub file having the name rna_transcription.go
and place your solution code in that file.

## Running the tests

To run the tests run the command `go test` from within the exercise directory.

If the test suite contains benchmarks, you can run these with the `--bench` and `--benchmem`
flags:

    go test -v --bench . --benchmem

Keep in mind that each reviewer will run benchmarks on a different machine, with
different specs, so the results from these benchmark tests may vary.
