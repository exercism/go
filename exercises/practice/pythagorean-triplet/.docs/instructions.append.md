## Implementation Notes

`Range` should return a list of all Pythagorean triplets with sides in the range `min` to `max` inclusive.

`Sum` should return a list of all Pythagorean triplets where the sum `a+b+c` (the perimeter) is equal to `p`.
The three elements of each returned triplet must be in order, `t[0] <= t[1] <= t[2]`, and the list of triplets must be in lexicographic order.
