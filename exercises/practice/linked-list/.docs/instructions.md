Implement a doubly linked list.


A *Linked list* is a dynamic collection of ordered items. The main building block of a *Linked list* is a *Node*. A single *Node* holds a data item and link(s) to other *Node(s)*. *Nodes* are linked together in some way and represent a *Linked list* itself.

There are several types of linked lists based on how *Nodes* are linked. Most popular ones are:
- *singly linked list* each node holds a value and a single link to the next node.
- *doubly linked list* each node holds a value and 2 links: to the previous node and to the next node.

If you want to know more about linked lists, check [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list).
