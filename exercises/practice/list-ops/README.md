# List Ops

Implement basic list operations.

In functional languages list operations like `length`, `map`, and
`reduce` are very common. Implement a series of basic list operations,
without using existing functions.

The precise number and names of the operations to be implemented will be 
track dependent to avoid conflicts with existing names, but the general
operations you will implement include:

* `append` (*given two lists, add all items in the second list to the end of the first list*);
* `concatenate` (*given a series of lists, combine all items in all lists into one flattened list*);
* `filter` (*given a predicate and a list, return the list of all items for which `predicate(item)` is True*);
* `length` (*given a list, return the total number of items within it*);
* `map` (*given a function and a list, return the list of the results of applying `function(item)` on all items*);
* `foldl` (*given a function, a list, and initial accumulator, fold (reduce) each item into the accumulator from the left using `function(accumulator, item)`*);
* `foldr` (*given a function, a list, and an initial accumulator, fold (reduce) each item into the accumulator from the right using `function(item, accumulator)`*);
* `reverse` (*given a list, return a list with all the original items, but in reversed order*);

## Coding the solution

Look for a stub file having the name list_ops.go
and place your solution code in that file.

## Running the tests

To run the tests run the command `go test` from within the exercise directory.

If the test suite contains benchmarks, you can run these with the `--bench` and `--benchmem`
flags:

    go test -v --bench . --benchmem

Keep in mind that each reviewer will run benchmarks on a different machine, with
different specs, so the results from these benchmark tests may vary.
