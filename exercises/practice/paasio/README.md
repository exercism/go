# Paasio

Report network IO statistics.

You are writing a [PaaS][], and you need a way to bill customers based
on network and filesystem usage.

Create a wrapper for network connections and files that can report IO
statistics. The wrapper must report:

- The total number of bytes read/written.
- The total number of read/write operations.

## Coding the solution

Look for a stub file having the name paasio.go
and place your solution code in that file.

## Running the tests

To run the tests run the command `go test` from within the exercise directory.

If the test suite contains benchmarks, you can run these with the `--bench` and `--benchmem`
flags:

    go test -v --bench . --benchmem

Keep in mind that each reviewer will run benchmarks on a different machine, with
different specs, so the results from these benchmark tests may vary.
