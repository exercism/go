# Implementation

Define
```type Classification```
for containing the classification values for natural numbers.
You may choose any representation for this type.

Define three Classification constants named
```
	ClassificationDeficient
	ClassificationPerfect
	ClassificationAbundant
```

Implement a function named Classify which accepts
an int64 input and returns a Classification and an error value.

Create an error named ErrOnlyPositive
which is returned when the input is not a positive integer.
