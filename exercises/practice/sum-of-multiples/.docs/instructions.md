# Instructions

Given a list of factors and a limit, add up all the unique multiples of the factors that are less than the limit.
All inputs will be greater than or equal to zero.

## Example

Suppose the limit is 20 and the list of factors is [3, 5].
We need to find the sum of all unique multiples of 3 and 5 that are less than 20.

Multiples of 3 less than 20: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18
Multiples of 5 less than 20: 5, 10, 15

The unique multiples are: 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18

The sum of the unique multiples is: 3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 18 = 78

So, the answer is 78.
