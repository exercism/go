## Simple Stub

The space_age.go "stub file" contains only one line with the correct
package name and nothing more.  This will be the usual pattern for future
exercises.  You will need to figure out the function signature(s).

One way to figure out the function signature(s) is to look
at the corresponding \*\_test.go file. It will show the package level
functions(s) that the test will use to verify the solution.

## Planet Type

The test cases make use of a custom `Planet` type that is sent to your function.
You will need to implement this custom type yourself.
Implementing this new custom type as a string should suffice.
