# Instructions

A complex number `z` is a number in the form `a + b * i` where `a` and `b` are real and `i` satisfies `i^2 = -1`.

`a` is called the real part and `b` is called the imaginary part of `z`.
* The conjugate of the number `z = a + b * i` is the number `z* = a - b * i`.
* The absolute value of a complex number `z = a + b * i` is a real number `|z| = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)`.
* The square of the absolute value `|z|^2` is the result of multiplication of `z` by its complex conjugate.

The sum/difference of two complex numbers involves adding/subtracting their real and imaginary parts separately:

```
# Addition
(a + i * b) + (c + i * d) = (a + c) + (b + d) * i

# Subtraction
(a + i * b) - (c + i * d) = (a - c) + (b - d) * i
```

Multiplication result is by definition:

```
(a + i * b) * (c + i * d) = (a * c - b * d) + (b * c + a * d) * i
```

The reciprocal of a non-zero complex number is:

```
1 / (a + i * b) = a/(a^2 + b^2) - b/(a^2 + b^2) * i
```


Dividing a complex number `a + i * b` by another `c + i * d` gives:

```
(a + i * b) / (c + i * d) = (a * c + b * d)/(c^2 + d^2) + (b * c - a * d)/(c^2 + d^2) * i
```


Raising the [Euler's constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_constant) `e` to a complex exponent can be expressed as:

```
e^(a + i * b) = e^a * e^(i * b)`
```
the last term of which is given by Euler's formula `e^(i * b) = cos(b) + i * sin(b)`


### Tasks

Implement the following operations:

- addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two complex numbers,
- conjugate, absolute value, exponent of a given complex number.

Assume the programming language you are using does not have an implementation of complex numbers.
