# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the basics of pointers and how they work in Go.

## Learning objectives

- Know how to create a pointer from a variable
- Know how to dereference a pointer
- Know the pitfalls of dereferencing a nil pointer
- Know how to work with pointers to structs
- Know which pointer are already pointers

## Out of scope

- Unsafe pointers
- Pointer receivers for methods (this is parts of the `methods` concept)

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `pointers`: how to work with pointers; referencing and dereferencing; pointers to structs; types that are already pointers

## Prerequisites

- `structs`
- `maps`
- `slices`
- `arithmetic-operators`
- `string-formatting`
- `packages`
