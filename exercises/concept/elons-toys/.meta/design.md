# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student about `methods` in Go.

## Learning objectives

- Know what a method is.
- Know how to write a method in Go.
- Know that a method can be attached to any custom type in the same package (not just structs).
- Know about a pointer vs value receiver.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `methods`

## Prerequisites

- `structs` since the introduction and exercise define methods on structs
- `pointers` to understand pointer receivers
- `functions` because in that exercise the student practiced writing function signatures
