# Instructions

Being hired by a big weather forecast company, your job is to maintain their code base. Scrolling through the code, you find it hard to follow what the code is actually doing. Good thing you know just the right thing to do!

## 1. Document package weather

Write a package comment for `package weather` that describes its contents. The package comment should introduce the package and provide information relevant to the package as a whole.

## 2. Document the CurrentCondition variable

Write a comment for the package variable `CurrentCondition`.

This should tell any user of the package what information the variable stores, and what they can do with it.

## 3. Document the CurrentLocation variable

Just like the previous step, write a comment for `CurrentLocation`.

## 4. Document the Forecast() function

Write a function comment for `Forecast()`. Your comments must describe what the function does, but not how it does it.
