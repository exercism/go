# Instructions

Jen is working in the sorting room in a large factory.
The sorting room needs to process anything that comes into it by categorizing it with a label.
Jen is responsible for things that were pre-categorized as numbers and needs a program to help her with the sorting.

Most primitive values should get straight-forward labels.
For numbers, she wants strings saying `"This is the number 2.0"` (if the number was 2).
Jen wants the same output for integers and floats.

There are a few `Box` interfaces that need to be unwrapped to get their contents.
For a `NumberBox`, she wants strings saying `"This is a box containing the number 3.0"` (if the `Number()` method returns 3).
For a `FancyNumberBox`, she wants strings saying `"This is a fancy box containing the number 4.0"`, but only if the type is a `FancyNumber`.

Anything unexpected should say `"Return to sender"` so Jen can send them back where they came from.

## 1. Describe simple numbers

Jen wants numbers to return strings like `"This is the number 2.0"` (including one digit after the decimal):

```go
fmt.Println(DescribeNumber(-12.345))
// Output: This is the number -12.3
```

## 2. Describe a number box

Jen wants number boxes to return strings like `"This is a box containing the number 2.0"` (again, including one digit after the decimal):

```go
fmt.Println(DescribeNumberBox(numberBoxContaining{12}))
// Output: This is a box containing the number 12.0
```

## 3. Implement a method extracting the number from a fancy number box

Jen needs a helper function to extract the number from a `FancyNumberBox`.
If the `FancyNumberBox` is a `FancyNumber`, extract its value and convert it from a `string` to an `int`.
Any other type of `FancyNumberBox` should return 0.

```go
fmt.Println(ExtractFancyNumber(FancyNumber{"10"}))
// Output: 10
fmt.Println(ExtractFancyNumber(AnotherFancyNumber{"4"}))
// Output: 0
```

## 4. Describe a fancy number box

If the `FancyNumberBox` is a `FancyNumber`, Jen wants strings saying `"This is a fancy box containing the number 4.0"`.
Any other type of `FancyNumberBox` should say `"This is a fancy box containing the number 0.0"`.

```go
fmt.Println(DescribeFancyNumberBox(FancyNumber{"10"}))
// Output: This is a fancy box containing the number 10.0
fmt.Println(DescribeFancyNumberBox(AnotherFancyNumber{"4"}))
// Output: This is a fancy box containing the number 0.0
```

NOTE: we should use the `ExtractFancyNumber` function!

## 5. Implement `DescribeAnything` which uses them all

This is the main function Jen needs which takes any input (the empty interface means any value at all: `interface{}`).
`DescribeAnything` should delegate to the other functions based on the type of the value passed in.
More specifically:

- `int` and `float64` should both delegate to `DescribeNumber`
- `NumberBox` should delegate to `DescribeNumberBox`
- `FancyNumberBox` should delegate to `DescribeFancyNumberBox`
- anything else should result in `"Return to sender"`

```go
fmt.Println(DescribeAnything(numberBoxContaining{12.345}))
// Output: This is a box containing the number 12.3
fmt.Println(DescribeAnything("some string"))
// Output: Return to sender
```
