# Introduction

## Type Conversion

Go requires explicit conversion between different types.
Converting between types (also known as **type casting**) is done via a function with the name of the type to convert to.
For example, to convert an `int` to a `float64` you would need to do the following:

```go
var x int = 42 // x has type int
f := float64(x) // f has type float64 (ie. 42.0)
```

## Converting between primitive types and strings

There is a `strconv` package for converting between primitive types (like `int`) and `string`.

```go
import "strconv"

var intString string = "42"
var i, err = strconv.Atoi(intString)

var number int = 12
var s string = strconv.Itoa(number)
```

## Type Assertions

Interfaces in Go can introduce ambiguity about the underlying type.
A type assertion allows us to extract the interface value's underlying concrete value using this syntax: `interfaceVariable.(concreteType)`.

For example:

```go
var input interface{} = 12
number := input.(int)
```

NOTE: this will cause a panic if the interface variable does not hold a value of the concrete type.

We can test whether an interface value holds a specific concrete type by making use of both return values of the type assertion: the underlying value and a boolean value that reports whether the assertion succeeded.
For example:

```go
str, ok := input.(string) // no panic if input is not a string
```

If `input` holds a `string`, then `str` will be the underlying value and `ok` will be true.
If `input` does not hold a `string`, then `str` will be the zero value of type `string` (ie. `""` - the empty string) and `ok` will be false.
No panic occurs in any case.

## Type Switches

A **type switch** can perform several type assertions in series.
It has the same syntax as a type assertion (`interfaceVariable.(concreteType)`), but the `concreteType` is replaced with the keyword `type`.
Here is an example:

```go
var i interface{} = 12 // try: 12.3, true, int64(12), []int{}, map[string]int{}

switch v := i.(type) {
case int:
    fmt.Printf("the integer %d\n", v)
case string:
    fmt.Printf("the string %s\n", v)
default:
    fmt.Printf("type, %T, not handled explicitly: %#v\n", v, v)
}
```
