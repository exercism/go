Go provides great primitives for control flow in the form of conditionals. They all have their uses but it is a convention to avoid `else` statements as Go allows early returns. 

Comming from other languages one may be tempted to try to use one-line conditionals. However this is not the Go's way of doing things, remember ["clear is better than clever"](https://dave.cheney.net/2019/07/09/clear-is-better-than-clever).
