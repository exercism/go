# Hints

## 1. Drive a car

- Add a field to the `Car` struct that keeps track of the driven distance
- Create a [method][method] that has a receiver of type `Car` and updates the driven distance

## 2. Display the distance driven

- Create a [method][method] that has a receiver of type `Car`
- Show the value of the _distance_ field

## 3. Display the battery percentage

- Create a [method][method] that has a receiver of type `Car`
- Show the value of the _battery_ field

## 4. Check if a remote car can finish a race

- Remember the car has a [method][method] to retrieve the distance it has driven
- Consider what to do when the battery has been drained before reaching the finish line
