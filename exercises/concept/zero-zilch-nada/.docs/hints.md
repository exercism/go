    }
    ```

## 1. Determine if a boolean is set to its zero value

- The zero value for the bool type is `false`.

## 2. Determine if an integer is set to its zero value

- The zero value for numeric types is `0`.

## 3. Determine if a string is set to its zero value

- The zero value for the string type is the empty string `""`.

## 4. Determine if a pointer is set to its zero value

- The zero value for the func type is `nil`.

## 5. Determine if a function is set to its zero value

- The zero value for the pointer type is `nil`.

## 6. Determine if an interface is set to its zero value

- The zero value for the map type is `nil`.

## 7. Determine if a slice is set to its zero value

- The zero value for the slice type is `nil`.

## 8. Determine if a channel is set to its zero value

- The zero value for the channel type is `nil`.

## 9. Determine if a map is set to its zero value

- The zero value for the interface type is `nil`.
