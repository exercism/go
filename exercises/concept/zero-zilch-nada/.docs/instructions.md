# Instructions

In this exercise, we will write some functions that determine whether or not the function parameter is the zero value for its respective type.

## 1. Determine if a boolean is set to its zero value

Adjust the `IsZeroBool` function to return `true` if the passed in `bool` is set to its zero value and `false` if it is not.

## 2. Determine if an integer is set to its zero value

Adjust the `IsZeroInt` function to return `true` if the passed in `int` is set to its zero value and `false` if it is not.

## 3. Determine if a string is set to its zero value

Adjust the `IsZeroString` function to return `true` if the passed in `string` is set to its zero value and `false` if it is not.

## 4. Determine if a pointer is set to its zero value

Adjust the `IsZeroPointer` function to return `true` if the passed in pointer is set to its zero value and `false` if it is not.

## 5. Determine if a function is set to its zero value

Adjust the `IsZeroFunc` function to return `true` if the passed in `func` is set to its zero value and `false` if it is not.

## 6. Determine if an interface is set to its zero value

Adjust the `IsZeroInterface` function to return `true` if the passed in interface is set to its zero value and `false` if it is not.

## 7. Determine if a slice is set to its zero value

Adjust the `IsZeroSlice` function to return `true` if the passed in slice is set to its zero value and `false` if it is not.

## 8. Determine if a channel is set to its zero value

Adjust the `IsZeroChannel` function to return `true` if the passed in channel is set to its zero value and `false` if it is not.

## 9. Determine if a map is set to its zero value

Adjust the `IsZeroMap` function to return `true` if the passed in map is set to its zero value and `false` if it is not.
