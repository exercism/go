# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student about `nil` and other zero values.

## Learning objectives

- Go assigns zero values to uninitialized variables according to the type the variable holds.
- The identifier `nil` is the zero value for pointers, channels, maps, interfaces, slices, and functions.
- Zero values for strings, numbers, and booleans are "", 0, and false, respectively.

## Out of scope

- Error checking.
- `Nil` checking.
- Usage of the above-mentioned types.

## Concepts

- `nil`
- `zero-values`

## Prerequisites

- `types`
