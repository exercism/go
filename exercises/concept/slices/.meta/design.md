## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the basics on how to work with slices in Go.

## Learning objectives

- instantiate (len, cap)
- append
- set value
- read value
- remove value
- taking length
- subslices
- expanding slices (e.g. in `append(slice1, slice2...)`)

## Out of scope

- deep dive into the inner workings of slices
- arrays

## Concepts

- `slices`

## Prerequisites

- iteration: fill a slice (Not yet available: `range iteration`)
- numbers: integers (uint8 and int) to represent cards
- functions: multiple return values, early return, parameters
- conditionals: mostly to check for existing indexes
