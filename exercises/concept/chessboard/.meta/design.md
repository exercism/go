# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to make the student familiar with the range loop on slices and maps.

## Learning objectives

- Know how to iterate a slice with a range loop
- Know how to iterate a map with a range loop
- Know how and when to omit the index with _
- Know how and when to omit the value by just providing one variable (don't use _ to omit the value!)
- Know how and when to omit both, index and value
- Know about the random order of map iteration

## Out of scope

- channel iteration
- string iteration

## Concepts

- range-iteration

## Prerequisites

- slices
- maps
- iteration
