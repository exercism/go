# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to make the student familiar with the range loop on slices and maps.

## Learning objectives

- Know how to iterate a slice with a range loop
- Know how to iterate a map with a range loop
- Know how and when to omit the index with \_
- Know how and when to omit the value by just providing one variable (don't use \_ to omit the value!)
- Know how and when to omit both, index and value
- Know about the random order of map iteration

## Out of scope

- channel iteration
- string iteration

## Concepts

- `range-iteration`

## Prerequisites

- `slices`
- `maps`
- `conditionals-if`
- `iteration`
- `for-loops`
