# Introduction

Error handling is **not** done via exceptions in Go.
Instead, errors are normal _values_ of types that implement the built-in `error` interface.

```go
type error interface {
    Error() string
}
```

This means that any type which implements an one simple method `Error()` that returns a `string` implements the `error` interface.
This allows a function with return type `error` to return values of different types as long as all of them satisfy the `error` interface.

## Creating and Returning Errors

You do not have to always implement the error interface yourself.
To create a simple error, you can use the `errors.New()` function that is part of the standard library package `errors`.
These error variables are also called _sentinel errors_ and by convention their names should start with `Err` or `err` (depending on whether they are exported or not).
You should use error variables instead of directly writing `errors.New` in cases where you use an error multiple times or where you want the consumer of your package to be able to check for the specific error.

```go
import "errors"

var ErrSomethingWrong = errors.New("something went wrong")
ErrSomethingWrong.Error() // returns "something went wrong"
```

An error is by convention the last value returned in a function with multiple return values.
If the function returns an error, it should always return the zero value for other returned values:

```go
import "errors"

// Do this:
func GoodFoo() (int, error) {
  return 0, errors.New("Error")
}

// Not this:
func BadFoo() (int, error) {
  return 10, errors.New("Error")
}
```

Return `nil` for the error when there are no errors:

```go
func Foo() (int, error) {
  return 10, nil
}
```

## Custom Error Types

If you want your error to include more information than just the error message string, you can create a custom error type.
As mentioned before, everything that implements the `error` interface (i.e. has an `Error() string` method) can serve as an error in Go.

Usually, a struct is used to create a custom error type.
By convention, custom error type names should end with `Error`.
Also, it is best to set up the `Error() string` method with a pointer receiver, see this [Stackoverflow comment][stackoverflow-errors] to learn about the reasoning.
Note that this means you need to return a pointer to your custom error otherwise it will not count as `error` because the non-pointer value does not provide the `Error() string` method.

```go
type MyCustomError struct {
  message string
  details string
}

func (e *MyCustomError) Error() string {
  return fmt.Sprintf("%s, Details: %s", e.message, e.details)
}

func someFunction() error {
  // ...
  return &MyCustomError{
    message: "...",
    details: "...",
  }
}
```

## Checking for Errors

Errors can be checked against `nil`.
It is recommended to return early in case of an error to avoid nesting the "happy path" of your code.

```go
func myFunc() error {
	file, err := os.Open("./users.csv")
	if err != nil {
		// handle the error
		return err // or e.g. log it and continue
	}

	// do something with file
}
```

Since most functions in Go include an error as one of the return values, you will see/use this `if err != nil` pattern all over the place in Go code.

You can compare error variables with the equality operator `==`:

```go
var ErrResourceNotFound = errors.New("resource not found")
// ...
if err == ErrResourceNotFound {
  // do something about the resource-not-found error
}
```

How to check for errors of a specific custom error type will be covered in later concepts.
