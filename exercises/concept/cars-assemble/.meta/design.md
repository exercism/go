# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student how to deal with numbers in Go.

## Learning objectives

- This should introduce the `int` and `float64` types (be basic number types in Go).
- It should introduce operations with numbers like multiplication, division, etc.
- Introduce basic type conversion between number types

My suggestion is to copy C# `numbers` exercise: https://github.com/exercism/v3/tree/master/languages/csharp/exercises/concept/numbers

## Concepts

- `numbers`
- `type-conversion`

## Prerequisites

- `constants`
- `confitionals-if`
