# Hints

## 1. Calculate the success rate

- Use if conditionals to return the values in the table.

## 2. Calculate the production rate per hour

- Use the `successRate` method coupled with the base rate (221 times the speed).
- When multiplying two numbers by one another, they both need to be of the same type.

## 3. Calculate the number of working items produced per minute

- Use the `CalculateProductionRatePerHour` function.
- Remember to cast the result to an `int`.
