# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach student the basics on how to work with pseudo-random numbers in Go.

## Learning objectives

- how to create pseudo random numbers with the math/rand package (float64 and int)
- what seeding is for and how/where to define the seed in the code
- that there are some helpers in the math/rand package line Shuffle and Perm
- when and how to create cryptographically secure random numbers with crypto/rand (does not have to be part of the exercise but would be good to mention in the concept to raise security awareness)

## Out of scope

- details of pseudo random number generation in general
- discussing the different algorithms for random number generation
- details on entropy sources etc

## Concepts

- `randomness`

## Prerequisites

- `numbers`
- `slices`

## Implementing

Here you can find the [Implementation Guide](https://github.com/exercism/v3/blob/master/languages/go/reference/implementing-a-concept-exercise.md).

## Help
