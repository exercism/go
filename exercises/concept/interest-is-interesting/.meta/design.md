# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know of the existence of the two floating point types: `float32` and `float64`.
- Know when to use which floating point type.

## Out of scope

- Parsing floating-point types from strings.
- Converting floating-point types to strings.
- Using standard or custom format strings.

## Concepts

- `floating-point-numbers`: know of the existing of the two floating point types: `float32` and `float64`.
  Know when to use which floating point type.

## Prerequisites

This exercise's prerequisites Concepts are:

- `numbers`: define numbers and apply arithmetic and boolean logic to them.
- `conditionals-if`: conditionally execute code based on value of floating-point numbers.
- `for-loops`: repeatedly execute code until a condition is met.
- `packages`: import the "math" package
- `type-conversion`: know how to convert between types
