# Design

## Goal

The goal here is to create a new concept exercise that teaches about structs that implement the `fmt.Stringer` interface.
That includes writing a concept and creating a new exercise.

## Learning objectives

The student should learn about the following topics and then practice them in the concept exercise:

- present the `fmt.Stringer` interface
- implement a struct that satisfies the `fmt.Stringer`
- use a type that satisfies `fmt.Stringer` with `fmt.Sprintf` and other methods of `fmt`

## Concepts

- `stringers`

## Prerequisites

- `strings`
- `string-formatting`
- `interfaces`
- `methods`
- `structs` 
## Story

Try to think of a story for the exercise that ties all the tasks together.
The story doesn't need to be highly complex.
Even a small story goes a long way to improve the enjoyment of the exercise.

## Resources

Some links that might be helpful as a starting point and/or for the links section of the concept:
