- Methods
- Anonymous functions
- Recursion

## Concepts

The Concept this exercise unlocks is:

## Notes

The story was inspired by the [Lasagna Master Exercise in the Javascipt track][javascript-lasagna-master].
Most tasks needed to be changed though to achieve an exercise that fits the Go learning objectives.
