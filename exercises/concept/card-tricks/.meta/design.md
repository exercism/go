# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the basics on how to work with slices in Go.

## Learning objectives

- instantiate (len, cap)
- append
- set value
- read value
- remove value
- taking length
- sub-slices
- expanding slices (e.g. in `append(slice1, slice2...)`)

## Out of scope

- deep dive into the inner workings of slices
- arrays

## Concepts

- `slices`
- `variadic-function`

## Prerequisites
 
- `numbers`: integers (`int`) to represent cards
- `conditionals-if`: mostly to check for existing indexes

## Implementing

Here you can find the [Implementation Guide](https://github.com/exercism/v3/blob/master/languages/go/reference/implementing-a-concept-exercise.md).
