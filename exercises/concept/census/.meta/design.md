# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student about the zero value of Go's types.

## Learning objectives

- Variables declared without an explicit initial value default to the zero value for their respective type.
- The zero values for strings, numeric types, and booleans are `""`, `0`, and `false`, respectively.
- The identifier `nil` is the zero value for pointers, channels, maps, interfaces, slices, and functions.

## Out of scope

- Error checking.
- Usage of the above-mentioned types.

## Concepts

- `nil`
- `zero-values`

## Prerequisites

- `maps`
- `structs`
- `numbers`
- `string-formatting`
- `booleans`
- `methods`
- `slices`
- `conditionals-if`
- `pointers`
