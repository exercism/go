# Hints

## 1. Create a new resident

- Revisit the [concept:go/structs]() concept for information on how to create structs.

## 2. Validate resident information

- The zero value for a string is `""`.
- The zero value for a map is `nil`.
- Revisit the [concept:go/maps]() concept for information on how to determine if a map key exists.

## 3. Delete resident information

- A resident is considered deleted when all of their fields are set to their zero value.
- Revisit the [concept:go/zero-values]() concept for the zero value for each Go type.

## 4. Count the residents

- Revisit the [concept:go/range-iteration]() concept for information on how to range over a slice.
