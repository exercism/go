# Hints

## 1. Create a new resident

- Revisit the [struct concept](/tracks/go/concepts/structs) for information on how to create structs.

## 2. Validate resident information

- The zero value for a string is `""`.
- The zero value for a map is `nil`.
- Revisit the [maps concept](/tracks/go/concepts/maps) for information on how to determine if a map key exists.

## 3. Delete resident information

- A resident is considered deleted when all of their fields are set to their zero value.
- Revisit the [zero values concept](/tracks/go/concepts/zero-values) for the zero value for each Go type.

## 4. Count the residents

- Revisit the [range iteration concept](/tracks/go/concepts/range-iteration) for information on how to range over a slice.
