# Design

## Learning objectives

- How to define an interface
- How to use an interface in a function signature
- How to create a type that implements a given interface

## Out of Scope

The following topics will be introduced later and should therefore not be part of this concept exercise.

- `errors`
- `type-assertions`

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `interfaces`

## Prerequisites

- `strings` to implement the functionality needed in the exercise
- `structs` to understand how to create a custom type
- `methods` to understand and implement interfaces
