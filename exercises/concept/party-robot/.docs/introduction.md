# Introduction

## Packages

In Go an application is organized in packages.
A package is a collection of source files located in the same folder.
All source files in a folder must have the same package name at the top of the file.
By convention packages are named to be the same as the folder they are located in.

```go
package greeting
```

Go provides an extensive standard library of packages which you can use in your program using the `import` keyword.
Standard library packages are imported using their name.

```go
package greeting

import "fmt"
```

An imported package is then addressed with the package name:

```go
world := "World"
fmt.Sprintf("Hello %s", world)
```

Go determines if an item can be called by code in other packages through how it is declared.
To make a function, type, variable, constant or struct field externally visible (known as _exported_) the name must start with a capital letter.

```go
package greeting

// Hello is a public function (callable from other packages).
func Hello(name string) string {
    return "Hello " + name
}

// hello is a private function (not callable from other packages).
func hello(name string) string {
    return "Hello " + name
}
```

## String Formatting

Go provides an in-built package called `fmt` (format package) which offers a variety of functions to manipulate the format of input and output.
The most commonly used function is `Sprintf`, which uses verbs like `%s` to interpolate values into a string and returns that string.

```go
import "fmt"

food := "taco"
fmt.Sprintf("Bring me a %s", food)
// Returns: Bring me a taco
```

In Go floating point values are conveniently formatted with Sprintf's verbs: `%g` (compact representation), `%e` (exponent) or `%f` (non exponent).
All three verbs allow the field's width and numeric position to be controlled.

```go
import "fmt"

number := 4.3242
fmt.Sprintf("%.2f", number)
// Returns: 4.32
```

You can find a full list of available verbs in the [format package documentation][fmt-docs].

`fmt` contains other functions for working with strings, such as `Println` which simply prints the arguments it receives to the console and `Printf` which formats the input in the same way as `Sprintf` before printing it.
