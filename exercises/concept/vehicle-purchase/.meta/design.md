# Design

## Learning objectives

- How to compare numbers and strings with relational operators (`<`, `>`, `>=`, `<=`)
- Equality checks with equals (`==`) and not equals (`!=`)
- How to write if-statements (`if`, `else-if`, `else`)

## Out of Scope

- `switch`, `for`

## Prerequisites

- `arithmetic-operators` because they are used to practice if-conditions
- `booleans` because they are the result of the comparison and used in the conditions
- `numbers` because they are used to practice comparison
- `strings` also because they are used to practice comparison

## Notes

The exercise is based on [Vehicle Purchase Exercise in the Javascript track][javascript-vehicle-purchase] (which is, in turn, inspired by [Vehicle Purchase Exercise in the Julia track][julia-vehicle-purchase])
