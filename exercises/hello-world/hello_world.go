// testVersion identifies the version of the test program that you are
// writing your code to. If the test program changes in the future --
// after you have posted this code to the Exercism site -- reviewers
// will see that your code can't necessarily be expected to pass the
// current test suite because it was written to an earlier test version.
//
// This is a convention done for Exercism exercises in the Go language track,
// it is not a requirement of the Go programming language.
//
// This test versioning setup will be common to all the exercises in the
// Go language track. When crafting your own solution file from scratch you
// will be expected to add this constant or the initial test will fail.
// The version number you should use will be found in the constant
// "targetTestVersion" in the test file, see ./hello_test.go for more
// information.
