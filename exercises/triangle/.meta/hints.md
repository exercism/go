## Contant Declarations

In this exercise you are asked to declare a series of constants used to identify
different types of triangles. Pick the data type you think works best for this
and get the tests passing.

Afterwards, it may be worth reading about Go's
predeclared identifier [iota](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Iota). There's an
excellent write up about it
[here](https://splice.com/blog/iota-elegant-constants-golang/).
