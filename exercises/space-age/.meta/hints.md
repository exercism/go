## No Stub

This may be the first Go track exercise you encounter without a stub: a
pre-existing `space_age.go` file for your solution. You may not see stubs in
the future and should begin to get comfortable with creating your own Go files
for your solutions.

One way to figure out what the function signature(s) you would need is to look
at the corresponding \*\_test.go file. It will show you what the package level
functions(s) should be that the test will use to verify the solution.

## Planet Type

The test cases make use of a custom `Planet` type that is sent to your function. You will need to implement this custom type yourself. Implementing this new custom type as a string should suffice.
