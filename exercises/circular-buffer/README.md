# Circular Buffer

A circular buffer, cyclic buffer or ring buffer is a data structure that
uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end.

A circular buffer first starts empty and of some predefined length. For
example, this is a 7-element buffer:

    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]

Assume that a 1 is written into the middle of the buffer (exact starting
location does not matter in a circular buffer):

    [ ][ ][ ][1][ ][ ][ ]

Then assume that two more elements are added — 2 & 3 — which get
appended after the 1:

    [ ][ ][ ][1][2][3][ ]

If two elements are then removed from the buffer, the oldest values
inside the buffer are removed. The two elements removed, in this case,
are 1 & 2, leaving the buffer with just a 3:

    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][3][ ]

If the buffer has 7 elements then it is completely full:

    [6][7][8][9][3][4][5]

When the buffer is full an error will be raised, alerting the client
that further writes are blocked until a slot becomes free.

When the buffer is full, the client can opt to overwrite the oldest
data with a forced write. In this case, two more elements — A & B —
are added and they overwrite the 3 & 4:

    [6][7][8][9][A][B][5]

3 & 4 have been replaced by A & B making 5 now the oldest data in the
buffer. Finally, if two elements are removed then what would be
returned is 5 & 6 yielding the buffer:

    [ ][7][8][9][A][B][ ]

Because there is space available, if the client again uses overwrite
to store C & D then the space where 5 & 6 were stored previously will
be used not the location of 7 & 8. 7 is still the oldest element and
the buffer is once again full.

    [D][7][8][9][A][B][C]

## Running the tests

To run the tests run the command `go test` from within the exercise directory.

If the test suite contains benchmarks, you can run these with the `--bench` and `--benchmem`
flags:

    go test -v --bench . --benchmem

Keep in mind that each reviewer will run benchmarks on a different machine, with
different specs, so the results from these benchmark tests may vary.
