## Exercism v2

**TLDR: Please open any pull-requests with the nextercism branch as the base branch.**

Exercism is currently being completely [rebuilt from the ground up](https://github.com/exercism/v2-feedback), under the codename **Nextercism**.
This effort includes significant changes to each language track, which means
changes to the exercise structure of this Go track repo, changes that are not
compatible with the current [exercism.io](http://exercism.io/) site.

Therefore there are [two version](https://v2.exercism.io/) of the Exercism site
at the moment. These different versions are reflected in this repo by the
[master](https://github.com/exercism/go/tree/master) branch (v1), and the
[nextercism](https://github.com/exercism/go/tree/nextercism) branch (v2). The
master branch is frozen for now, except for bug fixes, and new changes are being
merged onto the nextercism branch. This means that any changes should be made in
a branch based off the nextercism branch and any pull-requests should be made
with the nextercism branch as base. See the [Github docs](https://github.com/blog/2224-change-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request) for
how to change the base branch of a pull-request.

If you're in any doubt please do open an issue, we're more than happy to help
with any uncertainty about this. And thankyou for contributing!! :heart: :tada:

Please feel free to delete this blurb when you open your pull-request. :smiley:
