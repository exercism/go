# We expect users to use something fairly recent so we test the last two
# versions plus tip.  Update these freely as new versions of Go are released.
#
# We choose two versions since official support of Go mirrors this policy:
# Only the current major release (x.y) has full official support.
# The previous major release gets security-only support.
#
# Tip is useful to automatically test a version more recent than the
# the last time .travis.yml was looked at, and (unlikely as it might be)
# to alert us to any real upcoming change in the language that would be
# incompatible with our existing code.
#
# We may choose to test additional versions as time allows,
# as long as the number of entries in the build matrix doesn't exceed ten.
# These additional versions will not be required, so they're advisory only.
# Since Travis runs five jobs at a time, a limit of ten jobs makes sense.

# Travis runs in a 64 bit environment but beginning with Go 1.5, building a
# 32 bit target is as easy as specifying GOARCH.  We test both to accomodate
# users that might be running 32 bit environments and make sure our code
# works for them.
#
# Race detection is valuable for our problems that involve concurrency.
# The race detector isn't supported on 386 though.

# Travis doc for the install step says it is for any dependencies of the
# build.  We don't have any build dependencies so we can disable this with
# `install: true`.  (Actually we have to specify either true or something else
# here because the default step for this is currently `go get -t ./...` which
# doesn't work for us because some of our stub files have invalid Go syntax
# or duplicate definitions of the example files)
