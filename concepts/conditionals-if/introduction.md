# Introduction

Conditionals in Go are similar to conditionals in other languages.
The underlying type of any conditional operation is the `bool` type, which can have the value of `true` or `false`.
Conditionals are often used as flow control mechanisms to check for various conditions.

For checking a particular case an `if` statement can be used, which executes its code if the underlying condition is `true` like this:

```go
var value string

if value == "val" {
    return "was val"
}
```

In scenarios involving more than one case many `if` statements can be chained together using the `else if` and `else` statements.

```go
var number int
result := "This number is "

if number > 0 {
   result += "positive"
} else if number < 0 {
    result += "negative"
} else {
   result += "zero"
}
```

If statements can also include a short initialization statement that can be used to initialize one or more variables for the if statement.
For example:

```go
num := 7
if v := 2 * num; v > 10 {
    fmt.Println(v)
} else {
    fmt.Println(num)
}
// Output: 14
```

> Note: any variables created in the initialization statement go out of scope after the end of the if statement.
