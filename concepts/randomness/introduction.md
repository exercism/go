# Introduction

Package `math/rand` provides support for generating pseudo-random numbers.

Here is how to generate a random integer between `0` and `99`:

```go
import "math/rand"

n := rand.Intn(100) // n is a random int, 0 <= n < 100
```

Function `rand.Float64` returns a random floating point number between `0.0` and `1.0`:

```go
f := rand.Float64() // f is a random float64, 0.0 <= f < 1.0
```

There is also support for shuffling a slice (or other data structures):

```go
x := []string{"a", "b", "c", "d", "e"}
// shuffling the slice put its elements into a random order
rand.Shuffle(len(x), func(i, j int) {
	x[i], x[j] = x[j], x[i]
})
```

## Seeds

The number sequences generated by package `math\rand` are not truly random.  
They are completely determined by an initial `seed` value.
By default, the package uses the integer `1` as a seed.

In order to get a different sequence of random numbers, we need to specify a different seed value.
A simple approach is to use the "current time":

```go
rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
```

Setting the seed must be done **before** calling any of the functions that generate random numbers.
We usually only need to set the seed once in our program.
From one seed we can generate many random numbers.

If you don't call `rand.Seed`, then the package will produce the same sequence of random numbers each time your program runs!
