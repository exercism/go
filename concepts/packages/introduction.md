# Introduction

In Go an application is organized in packages.
A package is a collection of source files located in the same folder.
All source files in a folder must have the same package name at the top of the file.
By convention packages are named to be the same as the folder they are located in.

```go
package greeting
```

Go provides an extensive standard library of packages which you can use in your program using the `import` keyword.
Standard library packages are imported using their name.

```go
package greeting

import "fmt"
```

An imported package is then addressed with the package name:

```go
world := "World"
fmt.Sprintf("Hello %s", world)
```

Go determines if an item can be called by code in other packages through how it is declared.
To make a function, type, variable, constant or struct field externally visible (known as _exported_) the name must start with a capital letter.
This is analogous to how other programming languages like Java that use access modifiers such as `public` and `private`.

```go
package greeting

// Hello is a public function (callable from other packages).
func Hello(name string) string {
    return "Hello " + name
}

// hello is a private function (not callable from other packages).
func hello(name string) string {
    return "Hello " + name
}
```
