# About

In Go an application is organized in packages.
A package is a collection of source files located in the same folder.
All source files in a folder must have the same package name at the top of the file.
By convention packages are named to be the same as the folder they are located in.

```go
package greeting
```

Go provides an extensive standard library of packages which you can use in your program using the `import` keyword.
Standard library packages are imported using their name.

```go
package greeting

import "fmt"
```

Multiple packages can be imported at once by encoding them in parentheses.

```go
package greeting

import (
    "errors"
    "fmt"
)
```

Third party packages are imported using the url of the package's location.
A package can be given an alias when importing.
This can be used to avoid package name conflicts:

```go
package greeting

import (
	"errors"

	errs "github.com/pkg/errors"
)
```

An imported package is then addressed with the package name or alias:

```go
// using the internal errors package
errors.New("Connection not established")

// using the errors package located at github.com/pkg/errors by alias
errs.New("Connection not established")
```

Go determines if an item can be called by code in other packages through how it is declared.
To make a function, type, variable, or constant externally visible (known as [`exported`](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Exported_identifiers)) the name must start with a capital letter.
This is analogous to how other programming languages like Java that use access modifiers such as `public` and `private`.

```go
package greeting

// Hello is a public function (callable from other packages).
func Hello(name string) string {
    return "Hello " + name
}

// hello is a private function (not callable from other packages).
func hello(name string) string {
    return "Hello " + name
}
```

The same applies for field names in custom `struct` types - field names beginning in a capital letter are externally visible, those beginning in a lower case letter are not.
