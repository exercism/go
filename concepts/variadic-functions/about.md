# About

Usually, functions in Go accept only a fixed number of arguments.
However, it is also possible to write variadic functions in Go.

A variadic function is a function that accepts a variable number of arguments.

If the type of the last parameter in a function definition is prefixed by ellipsis `...`, then the function can accept any number of arguments for that parameter.

```go
func find(a int, b ...int) {
    // ...
}
```

In the above function, parameter `b` is variadic and we can pass 0 or more arguments to `b`.

```go
find(5, 6)
find(5, 6, 7)
find(5)
```

~~~~exercism/caution
The variadic parameter must be the last parameter of the function.

If you try to write code like this ...

```go
func find(...a int, b int) {}
```

... it will fail to compile with the syntax error `cannot use ... with non-final parameter b.`

Imagine the function above would work and we pass multiple arguments.
Then all those arguments will get assigned to `a` and nothing would be assigned to `b`.
Hence, variadic parameter must be provided at the end.

The way variadic functions work is by converting the variable number of arguments to a slice of the type of the variadic parameter.

Here is an example of an implementation of a variadic function.

```go
func find(num int, nums ...int) {
    fmt.Printf("type of nums is %T\n", nums)

    for i, v := range nums {
        if v == num {
            fmt.Println(num, "found at index", i, "in", nums)
            return
        }
    }

    fmt.Println(num, "not found in ", nums)
}

func main() {
    find(89, 90, 91, 95)
    // Output:
    // type of nums is []int
    // 89 not found in  [90 91 95]

    find(45, 56, 67, 45, 90, 109)
    // Output:
    // type of nums is []int
    // 45 found at index 2 in [56 67 45 90 109]

    find(87)
    // Output:
    // type of nums is []int
    // 87 not found in  []
}
```

In line `find(89, 90, 91, 95)` of the program above, the variable number of arguments to the find function are `90`, `91` and `95`.
The `find` function expects a variadic int parameter after `num`.
Hence these three arguments will be converted by the compiler to a slice of type `int` `[]int{90, 91, 95}` and then it will be passed to the find function as `nums`.

Sometimes you already have a slice and want to pass that to a variadic function.
This can be achieved by passing the slice followed by `...`.
That will tell the compiler to use the slice as is inside the variadic function.
The step described above where a slice is created will simply be omitted in this case.

```go
list := []int{1,2,3}
find(1, list...) // "find" defined as shown above
// Output:
// type of nums is []int
// 1 found at index 0 in [1 2 3]
```

It is important to note that `...` is not an actual rest and spread operator in Go. For example, the following code does not compile.

```go
func myFunc(a int, b int, c int) {
	// ...
}

func main() {
	nums := []int{1, 2, 3}
	myFunc(nums...)
}
```

This results in `invalid use of ... in call to myFunc` because `myFunc` does not have a variadic parameter.
`...` really only works in the specific scenarios explained above.
