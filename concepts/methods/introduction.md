# Introduction

A method is a function with a special _receiver_ argument.
The receiver appears in its own argument list between `func` keyword and the name of the method.

```go
func (receiver type) MethodName(parameters) (returnTypes) {

}
```

You can only define a method with a receiver whose type is defined in the same package as the method.

```go
type Person struct {
    Name string
}

func (p Person) Greetings() string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("Welcome %s!", p.Name)
}

s := Person{Name: "Bronson"}
fmt.Println(s.Greetings())
// Output: Welcome Bronson!
```

There are two types of receivers, value receivers, and pointer receivers.

Methods with a value receiver operate on a copy of the value passed to it, meaning that any modification done to the receiver inside the method is not visible to the caller.

You can declare methods with pointer receivers in order to modify the value to which the receiver points.
This is done by prefixing the type name with a `*`, for example with the `rect` type, a pointer receiver would be declared as `*rect`.
Such modifications are visible to the caller of the method as well.

```go
type rect struct {
	width, height int
}
func (r *rect) squareIt() {
	r.height = r.width
}

r := rect{width: 10, height: 20}
fmt.Printf("Width: %d, Height: %d\n", r.width, r.height)
// Output: Width: 10, Height: 20

r.squareIt()
fmt.Printf("Width: %d, Height: %d\n", r.width, r.height)
// Output: Width: 10, Height: 10

```
